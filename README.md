# gramcracker

A proxy for a super stripped-down subset of the Instagram API, adding support for cross-origin requests.

This is only exposing the bare-minimum routes and payloads that I happen to need at the moment, but feel free to open issues or pull requests if there's anything else you'd like to see in here.

## Routes

* `/tag/:name` â€“ response: `{ link: 'http://instagram.com/p/kh9JBrMBPd/', photo: 'http://photos-a.ak.instagram.com/hphotos-ak-xpf1/1742420_657758154289744_647674322_n.jpg' }`
